Analyzing a PCAP file that contains a capture of an attack.
For this project, I have a PCAP file that contains the packets that were captured at the time of the attack. I used this file to analyze and determine what has happened during the attack while categorizing the attack steps into Cyber Kill Chain phases. The PCAP file was analyzed in Security Onion OS using built-in IDS tools. Squert, Sguil, Elsa and Network Miner are some of the tools used in the project to figure out what the attacker has done during the intrusion and to restore the files using network miner.
